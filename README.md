# Stroke Prediction Dataset

This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains anonymized Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for a dataset of slightly over 5000 individuals. The goal of this dataset is to study the factors that may or may not contribute to the likelihood of someone experiencing a heart stroke.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various personal characteristics and health-related information for each individual. The variables include demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and other attributes that may be associated with the occurrence of a stroke.

Please note that due to the sensitive nature of EHRs, the dataset has been anonymized and the source is kept private. The dataset is intended for research and analysis purposes only.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationships and patterns within the dataset to gain insights into the factors that may influence the occurrence of a heart stroke. By understanding these factors, we aim to contribute to the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies for cardiovascular health.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The data was explored, and cleaned as the missing values were dropped.

Plotly and Streamlit were used to conduct Data Visualization.
